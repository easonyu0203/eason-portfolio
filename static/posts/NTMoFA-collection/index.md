## **Introduction 🌟**

**Project Name:** Interactive Engagement System for National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts (NTMoFA)

While serving as a Backend Developer and ML Engineer at Glowing MultiMedia Company, I had the wonderful opportunity to contribute to a unique and immersive event,「時代紀藝:國美 **35** 典藏精選展」, held at NTMoFA. Our vision was to amplify user engagement by allowing attendees to interact with the artwork in an innovative and educational manner, utilizing their mobile devices to delve deeper into each masterpiece.

## **Problem Statement 🤔**

### **Challenge:**

Our main challenge was the lengthy and inefficient iteration process. The museum’s location, being a 5-hour train journey away, required extensive travel every time new training data was required, resulting in significant time delays in model training and refinement.

### **Objective:**

To expedite the iteration process by developing a real-time, efficient, and user-friendly system enabling on-the-spot model testing and instant error reporting.

## **Solution 🛠️**

### **Approach:**

I decided to leverage SvelteKit, Firebase, and FastAPI to develop a responsive web interface that could be easily accessed via mobile phones, optimizing the tech stack to ensure rapid development and deployment.

### **System Mechanics:**

The interface allowed team members to capture images and receive instant predictions from the ML backend. Any discrepancies in predictions could be reported with a click, saving the erroneous capture to the database for further analysis and dataset enhancement.

### **Innovation:**

This initiative resulted in a significant reduction in unnecessary travel, saving approximately two working days, allowing the team to allocate their time more effectively.
