## **Introduction**

During my internship at CMoney, the leading trading app company in Taiwan, I was bestowed with a unique opportunity. Unlike many interns, I got a chance to work hands-on with a real-world, production-ready application, playing a pivotal role as the sole backend developer for the recruitment website's API service.

## **Motivation & Context 🚀**

Being assigned this project was more than just a task; it was a testament to the trust and confidence my supervisor had in me. Moreover, the thrill wasn’t just in building the service, but in the fact that it would be used for the recruitment season at National Taiwan University, which is my uni! Knowing that my friends and peers would interact with my work made this assignment deeply personal and inspiring.

## **Technical Details 🛠**

Working closely with frontend engineers, I experienced the collaborative dynamics of a large company and delved deep into the professional workflow, such as Scrum. The heart of my assignment involved:

- Developing an API server using ASP.NET.
- Ensuring comprehensive documentation and logging to facilitate easy troubleshooting and future upgrades.
- Designing a system to safely store resumes directly to the HR file system.

## **Challenges & Key Takeaways 📘**

While the task seemed straightforward, transitioning from academic projects to a production-ready application was enlightening. Here's what I learned:

- Even simple services demand rigorous testing and adherence to coding standards.
- Clarity and documentation are crucial, ensuring that other developers can seamlessly understand and work with my code.
- The importance of collaboration and effective communication in a professional setting.

## **Achievement 🏆**

Successfully deploying the service for the recruitment season was a moment of pride, not just because it worked flawlessly, but because it underscored my growth and the trust vested in me. I became the only intern to work on a production application, marking a significant milestone in my budding career.
